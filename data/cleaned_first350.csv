"She was noted to be incontinent of urine, but not feces.",0
"Given underlying malignancy, there was concern for bony metastases or cord involvement, with alternative consideration given to epidural abscess, prompting transient initiation of empiric antibiotic coverage with vancomycin/cefepim ___ to ___.",0
"Despite frequent persuasive efforts, she declined multiple attempts at lumbosacral MRI, including with lorazepam premedication, citing claustrophobia.",0

Pain was controlled with acetaminophen and tramadol as needed.,0
Hematemesis:,0
"She experienced a single episode of small volume emesis, reportedly approximately 100cc, streaked with blood and found to be guiac positive.",0
Vital signs and hematocrit remained stable.,0
"IV pantoprazole was initiated for gastrointestinal prophylaxis, with subsequent discontinuation of PPI given no recurrence and questionable if first episode was true blood vs. red popsicle was eating at time.",0
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was deferred in the absence of recurrent hematemesis; no prior EGDs were available in OMR.,0
(5) Altered mental status:,0

"Infectious work up, including blood and urine cultures and CTA on admission with subsequent CXRs, was unrevealing.",0
Noncontrast head CT was negative for acute intracranial process.,0
Brain MRI for definitive exclusion of metastases could not be obtained due to claustrophobia/MRI aversion as above.,0
ABG on ___,0
without signs of CO2 retention.,0
History of opiates making patient sleepy per HCP as possible contributing factor and therefore these were discontinued.,0
Hepatic encephalopathy also on differential given metastatic lesions to liver and asterixis on exam.,0
AMS could also be ___ to severe depression.,0
Mental status monitored and remained stable and patient at baseline per HCP on discharge.,0
(6) Shortness of breath: She presented with acute onset shortness of breath without frank hypoxia.,0
"CTA on admission was negative for pulmonary embolus, though (subsegmental clot could not be excluded definitively), pleural effusion, or focal infiltrate.",0
EKG and cardiac enzymes were reassuring against acute coronary syndrome.,0
"Low voltages on EKG were consistent with prior, hence limited suspicion for pericardial effusion.",0
"Shortness of breath resolved over the course of admission without dedicated treatment, with the exception of nebulizers and expectorants as needed.",0
"(7) Leukocytosis: White blood cell count was elevated and peaked at 20.6, consistent with recent baseline, likely reflecting underlying malignancy.",0
"As noted above, infectious work up including CTA, urine and blood cultures, and CXRs, was unrevealing.",0
"She remained afebrile, with the exception of isolated transient fever to 100, with stable vital signs.",0
"(8 )Liver function test abnormalities: AST remained elevated ___ to ___, alkaline phosphatase 260s to 380s, and total bilirubin 2.1 to 2.6, likely due to hepatic infiltration of malignancy.",0
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for cholecystitis or obstructive process.,0
"The possibility of superimposed intraabdominal process, such as infection, could not be excluded in the setting of abdominal pain with emesis as above, but she declined CT for further evaluation.",0
"(9) Elevated lactate: Lactate was found to be 2.7-3.8 throughout admission despite copious IV fluids, likely reflecting compromised hepatic clearance in the setting of malignant infiltration.",0
(10) Sinus tachycardia:,0
"She remained persistently tachycardic 100s to 115s throughout admission in the setting of poor PO intake, but incompletely responsive to copious IV fluids.",0
Tachycardia has been present since at least ___.,0
"Despite concurrent leukocytosis and elevated lactate, there was no clear infectious source, hence low suspicion for sepsis.",0
"Subsegmental pulmonary embolus could not be excluded on the basis of admission CTA, but shortness of breath was short lived, and she was never hypoxic.",0
"Hematocrit remained stable without signs of active bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as above.",0
"(11) Depression: She appeared depressed with flat affect and seeming anhedonia throughout admission, with underlying depression likely affecting motivation to seek diagnosis and treatment of known malignancy.",0
"She denied active suicidal ideation and frequently declined home sertraline, particularly prior to liver biopsy, believing that it was supposed to be held preprocedurally despite explanation to the contrary.",0
She was seen by social work throughout admission.,0
(12) Normocytic anemia:,0
"Hematocrit remained stable and consistent with recent baseline at 27 to 33 throughout admission, seemingly due to anemia of chronic disease on the basis of preadmission labs.",0
"Vital signs remained stable, with the exception of persistent tachycardia, without signs of active bleeding apart from isolated blood streaked emesis as above.",0
"(13) Coagulopathy: INR of 1.2 to 1.8 was felt to reflect synthetic dysfunction in the setting of hepatic infiltration of malignancy, as well as poor oral intake.",0
"There were no signs of active bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as above.",0

The pigtail is again located partly within the collection and partly outside its wall.,0
"Interval increase in size of the left pelvic fluid collection, now measuring 14.7 x 16.2 x 23.3 cm (previously 13.6 x 13.9 x 23.0 cm).",0
Increased peripheral enhancement may suggest superimposed infection.,0
No new fluid collection identified.,0
CTA ABD & PELVIS ___,0
"Decrease in size of right lower quadrant fluid collection that has percutaneous drain within it, with areas of high attenuation on noncontrast exam consistent with blood products, and associated hyperemia which is likely inflammatory, but without evidence of contrast extravasation.",0

"year old women with a history of bladder cancer s/p cystectomy, hysterectomy, and BSO now with ileal conduit, whose post operative course has been complicated by DVT/PE, ileus, and pelvic fluid collections w/ one LLQ drain presented with subjective fevers, lethargy, and bloody drain output.",0
She was found to have worsening anemia and was given 2 units of pRBC with appropriate increase in hemoglobin noted.,0
She was also found on CT imaging to have an interval increase in size of a left abdominal fluid collection.,0
Decision was made to place a drain per ID.,0
"Fluid was sent and revealed: negative cultures, negative malignant cells, no evidence of lymphatic or urinary fluid.",0
This new drain was subsequently removed per ___,0
as fluid collection was completely drained.,0
The prior drain was still draining serosanguinous fluid and was kept in but repositioned.,0
"ID was consulted for the fevers, leukocytosis and fluid collections and was deemed to need antibiotics and tranisitioned from broad spectrum to IV ertapenem at discharge.",0
Will require multiple follow ups and imaging as specified in the transitional issues.,0
ACUTE ISSUES: ============= Pelvic fluid collections: patient arrived with one anterior drain putting out serosanguinous fluid.,0
"CT abdomen/pelvis revealed enlarging left fluid collection, and decision was made to place a drain per ___.",0
The fluid was negative for malignant cells.,0
The fluid had Cr 1 and triglycerides <9 suggesting that fluid collection is neither urine nor lymphatic fluid.,0

trichinella Ab (pending at time of discharge).,0
"Pt's family most concerned with PMR, however reassured pattern does not seem c/w this.",0

"We held off on empiric steroids until after the bx, and upon initiation, drastic improvement on sxs was noted.",0
"Ultimately, thought was that possibly myositis ___",0
traumatic fall on left hand side with underlying crystal arthropathy (however not enough fluid on MRI or US to tap).,0

Discontinued PICC ___,0
"and patient was not anticoagulated, after discussion with surgery and heme/onc the decision was not to anti-coagulate due to ongoing wound complications and poor overall prognosis.",0
AMS: most likely secondary to ICU delirium with waxing and waning mental status.,0
Mental status improved significantly during ICU course and patient was placed on seroquel qhS PRN.,0
This was continued while on the floor.,0
Her mentation did not improve much and has ongoing delirium.,0
Lactic acidosis: Combination of tissue disruption from surgery and hypoperfusion from above.,0
Lactate improved with improved BP.,0

Discharge Instructions:,0
An abscess is a pocket of fluid near the rectum that becomes infected.,0
The fluid usually occurs at the site of the anal glands that we all have.,0
The fluid can become infected and require drainage.,0
"Once they are drained, they start to feel better very quickly.",0
Most heal completely.,0
Thirty to fifty percent of abscesses either fail to heal over the next ___,0
weeks or recur at some point in your lifetime.,0
"The gland that started the infection may form a fistula, which is a small tunnel connecting the anal gland to the skin of the buttocks outside the anus.",0
Keeping your follow-up appointment is important because it allows us to determine if you develop a fistula.,0
Wound Care You have a malecot drain that is sutured securely on your buttocks in order to drain the abscess.,0
This drain should be flushed every day for hygiene.,0
The dressings that are in place may be removed the following morning or at the first bowel movement.,0
Any packing can be removed at that time or while sitting in the tub.,0
"You should expect bloody, foul drainage for several days.",0
"This is not a sterile area, and no fancy dressings are required.",0
Dressings mostly act to prevent staining of your undergarments.,0
Feminine mini ___,0
"pads may be easiest to use, and simple gauze pads are also OK.",0
Limiting the use of tape may aid in your comfort.,0
You should begin warm soaks in the bathtub ___,0
tub after you remove the packing.,0
These soaks may be helpful at relaxing the anal muscle spasms and thus decrease your pain.,0
They may be done for ___,0
"minutes at a time up to every four hours, but at least twice per day.",0
"The warm soaks also allow for irrigation of the abscess cavity, which will help speed healing.",0
"When in the tub, gentle finger pressure can be applied to the skin around the abscess opening to make sure that it is still completely drained.",0
Cleansing after bowel movements must be performed gently.,0
Baby wipes can be helpful at getting clean with little trauma.,0
Flushable adult wipes are also available.,0
Avoid any medicated wipes as these may contain witch ___ or alcohol.,0
They will cause discomfort.,0
Wiping can be avoided all together if one goes directly to the warm soaks after a bowel movement.,0
Nothing needs to be added to the water.,0
"Bubbles, oils, or Epsom salts may be added if this improves your comfort or sense of cleaning.",0
The water should not be so hot as to risk a burn injury.,0
Bowel Regimen It is often difficult to move your bowels after anal surgery.,0
Pain and narcotic pain medications are constipating.,0
It is important to keep the bowels moving.,0
The stool only becomes harder if you do not move them for days.,0
You should eat a regular healthy diet.,0
You should take an over-the counter stool softener (Colace [sodium docusate] 100 mg twice daily or Surfak,0
[docusate calcium] 240 mg once daily) to keep the stools soft.,0
It must be taken with ___,0
glasses of liquid throughout the day.,0
"You should also take one teaspoon dose of a fiber supplement (psyllium, Metamucil, Citrucel, Benefiber) daily to keep the bowels soft and moving.",0
Fluids are also required for these to help.,0
"Gentle stimulant laxatives (milk of magnesia, dulcolax, senna) should be taken only if you have not moved your bowels for one or two days.",0
"At times, all three of these (stool softener, fiber, and laxative) may be required to help the bowels.",0
It is important not to take so much that you have diarrhea.,0
Activity No driving or working until off narcotic pain medications.,0
"Otherwise, you may return to work when you feel that you are able.",0
Avoid activity that can cause direct trauma to the area.,0
Your activity is limited mostly by your discomfort.,0
Pain Medication Pain should improve every day after the drainage of the abscess.,0
No pains should be getting worse.,0
Increased pain at the time of bowel movements is expected.,0
"Pain can be controlled with Tylenol, ibuprofen, or a prescription pain medication.",0
No topical ointments or topical antibiotics are required.,0
"If you were given a prescription for antibiotic pills, please take them as directed.",0
NOTIFY THE DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING OCCUR:,0
"Fever greater than 101 degrees, swelling in the area, or increased pain, as these can be signs of infection.",0
Heavy drainage is common from these wounds.,0
Inability to move your bowels despite the previous laxative recommendation Inability to urinate.,0
Pain and surgery can make it hard to void.,0
Sometimes sitting in warm soaks helps to get started.,0
Heavy bleeding.,0

"yo man with chronic atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CAD s/p stents on plavix and aspirin, and history of rectal cancer s/p resection and ostomy reconstruction, presents with anemia and dark stools. 1) Anemia/GI bleed: On presentation the patient was anemic with melena, but he was hemodynamically stable and relatively asymptomatic.",0
"Hematocrit on presentation was 26.1 so he was not immediately transfused, but he did have large bore IV's inserted and received fluid boluses.",0
"He was also started on BID PPI therapy and his anticoagulants (aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin) were held.",0
"His second hematocrit had dropped to 23.3, but as there was not a great deal of stool or blood in his ostomy bag this was presumed to be more consistent with dilution than continued brisk bleeding.",0
"Still, at that time transfusion was offered, but the patient was quite reluctant and as he continued to be hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic transfusion was held.",0
As the day progressed hematocrit rose back to 25 and remained stable throughout the rest of his hospitalization.,0
Gastroenterology was consulted on the day after presentation and planned to take the patient for EGD after allowing the INR to fall for a day.,0
"Unfortunately, the INR remained elevated, but at that point gastroenterology elected to proceed with EGD with a plan not to do any interventions unless their was overt, active bleeding.",0
On EGD the patient had gastritis and duodenitis but no ulcers or obvious other sources of bleeding.,0
"___, no intervention was performed and the patient was discharged on BID PPI and with a reduced anticoagulant regimen to follow up in GI clinic.",0

The patient has history of coronary artery disease and had bare metal stents placed in ___.,0
"Nevertheless, he never had chest pain or other signs of active ischemia.",0
His aspirin and clopidogrel were held on presentation due to concern for active bleeding.,0
At discharge he was restarted on warfarin and aspirin but as it was greater than one year out from his stent placement it was considered safe to hold clopidogrel at discharge in order to decrease the number of anticoagulants the patient was taking.,0
"The patient's cardiologist, Dr ___, was made aware of this decision and thought it was reasonable.",0
3)Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has an EF of 35% by previous echocardiograms but never showed signs of acute volume overload or evidenced dyspnea in the hospital.,0
"Initially, his aspirin, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, and diuretic were held in the context of potentially active bleeding and concern about hemodynamic stability.",0

_ is a ___,0
"year old male with h/o CAD s/p stenting, systolic CHF (EF40-45%), atrial fibrillation, h/o cardiac arrest with heart block s/p AICD/pacemaker, trach/PEG, and recent ICU admission with GI bleed, hematuria, and MRSA bacteremia, who presented from rehab with fevers and persistent MRSA bacteremia while on vancomycin.",0
MRSA Bacteremia: The source of the patient's persistent bacteremia was not found.,0
He grew MRSA from multiple blood cultures at rehab and also on initial presentation despite appropriate vancomycin troughs.,0
Multiple sources of persistent seeding were considered.,0
He had a TTE and TEE which were both negative for vegetations and did not show any involvement of his pacer leads.,0
A tagged WBC scan was performed to look for occult focus of infection which was negative.,0
An upper extremity ultrasound was also performed to look for possible infected clot but was negative.,0
His PICC line which had been recently replaced at ___ was removed.,0
A new one was not placed until he had negative blood cultures.,0
He was continued on vancomycin and dosing was changed to 1g q48h.,0
Further blood cultures were negative.,0
Ultimately it was felt he likely has an endovascular source but it was not found during this hospitalization.,0
"He should be continued on IV vancomycin for 6 weeks from the date of his last positive blood culture, with last day ___.",0
Pseudomonas and Klebsiella UTI:,0
Given that he has an indwelling foley it was suspected that this might be colonization however his cultures were positive even after changing his foley.,0
He was found to have pseudomonas in his urine as well as wound culture.,0
It was multidrug resistant pseudomonas and he was treated with tobramycin for a seven day course.,0
He needs one more dose of tobramycin 320mg IV x 1 when trough <,0
He also grew multidrug resistant klebsiella in his urine and was started on a 7 day course of cefepime with last day ___.,0
Fevers:,0
He had fevers on admission felt to be related to his MRSA bacteremia.,0
Other cultures returned positive as above.,0
He also had a knee arthrocentesis which was not consistent with septic arthritis.,0
His PICC was changed after a 24 hour line holiday.,0
He was ruled out for C diff.,0
Acute renal failure: BUN/creatinine elevated to 70/1.7 on admission felt to be related to ongoing infection and poor forward floor from chronic systolic CHF.,0
His creatinine slowly improved with diuresis.,0
Chronic respiratory failure: He was continued on mechanical ventilation during this admission and was unable to be weaned to trach mask for any length of time.,0
This was felt to be related to chronic respiratory fatigue in addition to substantial pulmonary edema.,0
"Diuresis was difficult due to his large obligate fluid intake, but was eventually acheived with lasix 80mg IV q6h plus metolazone 2.5mg po bid.",0
His metolazone may need to be decreased over the next several days if he is overdiuresed as he was on average 1L negative on this regimen for the few days prior to discharge.,0
"On the day of discharge, he was on pressure support ___, PEEP 5, FiO2 50% with TV in the 300's. .",0
Anemia:,0
His hematocrit remained stable in the low 20's during this admission.,0
Chronic Diastolic CHF: Has EF 55%.,0
He was continued on his home carvedilol.,0
His lisinopril has been on hold indefinitely and was not restarted due to renal failure.,0
He was diuresed with IV lasix and metolazone as above and will need his creatinine and electrolytes monitored closely with ongoing diuresis.,0
Sacral decubitus ulcer: Stage IV.,0
He was started on a fentanyl patch and continued on prn oxycodone for pain control.,0
Atrial fibrillation:,0
His heart rate and blood pressure remained stable during this admission.,0
He is off anticoagulation due to h/o GI bleeding and hemothorax.,0
He was continued on carvedilol.,0

Elevate scrotum to assess with edema.,0
Waffles bilateral feet.,0
Apply aloe vesta ointment to dry intact skin daily. 11.,0
Support nutrition and hydration.,0
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Monitor I/O's closely and check electrolytes closely given large doses of lasix and metolazone.,0
need to back off on metalazone if signs of overdiuresis.,0
"However, would continue to aim for -500cc daily I/O balance. - Needs tobramycin trough drawn ___ AM.",0
Give tobramycin 320mg IV x 1 when trough is <1.0. - Continue vancomycin until ___,0
for MRSA bacteremia.,0
Should have trough measured intermittently to assess for appropriate dosing. - Needs 2 more days of cefepime treatment - Continue ventilator weaning and trach collar trials if possible.,0

"male with extensive cardiac PMH, recent MRSA bacteremia, trach on chronic mechanical ventilation, and chronic foley catheter with recent pseudomonal/klebsiella UTI, who presents now from rehab with fever, leukocytosis, vomiting, and AMS in setting enterococcus and yeast UTI, ___, MRSA bacteremia, hematochezia, and Stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer. .",0
ACUTE ISSUES .,0
MRSA Bacteremia:,0
Pt had recurrent MRSA bacteremia in the settting of vancomycin treatment.,0
We are particularly concerned about endocarditis from ICD given the refractory nature.,0
"However, removal of instrumentation is not an option per patietn and family wishes.",0
"Source of infection include sacral decubitous ulcer, UTI, ventilation.",0
Pt does not have leukocytosis or fever.,0
Chronic colonization likely.,0
Complete bacterial clearance is unlikely in this setting.,0
"OUTPATIENT ISSUES - START Daptomycin indefinitely - PICC line in place, routine care .",0
GIB: Pt presented with HCT drop and Bright red blood through ostomy.,0
He received a total of 3 units pRBC blood transfusion.,0
"We temporarily stopped tube feeding the setting of GIB, and discontinued his aspirin.",0
His HCT has been stable in the past 48 hours without transfusion.,0
"GI has been consulted, and did not feel that the benefit of osteostomy-scope outweighs its risk.",0
OUTPATIENT ISSUES - CONTINUE tube feeding as scheduled - STOP aspirin and anti-platelets forever.,0
"- START pantoprazole 40 mg iv bid - CONTINUE ferrous sulfate, sucrafate .",0
Pt presented with elevated Cr to 3.5 on admission with anuria.,0
"There was muddy brown cast on urine sedimentation, concerning for ATN in the setting of sepsis and tobramycin exposure.",0
"We gave him gentle fluid challenge, and his urine output recovered shortly afterwards.",0
His creatinine decreased to 2.7 on the day of discharge.,0
This may or may not ever go back down to his previous baseline.,0
"Regardless, he's not anuric and patient and family have refused initiation of dialysis.",0
OUTPATIENT ISSUES - AVOID nephrotoxic medication - DISCONTINUE Lisinopril .,0
Hematuria and UTI:,0
Pt has indwelling foley catheter and presented with hematuria and positive UA.,0
"Urine culture was notable for VRE, fungus.",0
We treated him with meropenem and fluconazole while he was in the MICU.,0
He received bladder irrigation for hematuria.,0
His hematuria resolved on the day of discharge.,0
Pt was asymptomatic from his UTI.,0
We felt it is impossible to completely treat his UTI.,0
We decided to withdrawal treatment for now to minimize the hepatic and renal drug intoxication. .,0
Decubitus ulcer:,0
Pt has a Stage 4 decubitus ulcer over sacrum and left thigh.,0
The pain from decubitous ulcer is his major concern while he was here.,0
He was seen by wound care.,0
They advise supportive care.,0
"OUTPATIENT ISSUES - Pleae CHANGE BODY POSITION every 2 hours - Please provide adequate pain management with lidocaine patch, fentanyl, oxycodone. .",0
Positive sputum culture:,0
Pt has trach tube.,0
His sputum culture grew multiresistant klebsiella and pseudomonas.,0
"Pt remained afebrile, no leukocytosis, left shift or increased sputum production.",0
We felt the complete irradiation was unlikey given his current clinical status and suspect he has permanent colonization. .,0
CHRONIC ISSUES .,0
Chronic dCHF:,0
Pt has diastolic CHF.,0
We continued his beta-blocker for the need of rate control.,0
We held his lisinopril in an hope of protecting his current kidney function.,0
We held his aspirin in the setting of GI bleeding.,0
We felt that active treatment for his CHF is less of a priority.,0
OUTPATIENT ISSUES - DISCONTINUED Aspirin and all antiplatelet drugs - DISCONTINUED Lisinopril .,0
Atrial fibrillation:,0
Pt is AV paced on telemetry.,0
Not on anticoagulation given history of GI bleeding.,0
Rate controlled with carvedilol.,0
"OUTPATIENT ISSUES - Per our EP recommendation, they can disable the defibrillator function, while still keep AV pacing, if there is a need in the change of goal of care. .",0
Depression: Continue citalopram. .,0
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES Pt declared a code status of DNR/DNI.,0
Extensive discussion has occurred between family and care provider team on goal of care.,0
"In general, our understanding is that family would like continued conservative treatment, with no invasive procedure, including the use of pressors.",0
We have conveyed clearly to the family that clinical improvement is unlikely in the current situation.,0
"Pt's family expressed concerns that patient has not been getting enough comfort care (ie skin, wound, pain). .",0
The wife has expressed continued frustration with being transferred back and forth from rehab to the hospital.,0
We assured her that the care provided to him at rehab is very good.,0
"In general, we'd try to limit the number of unecessary hospitalizations.",0
"We explained to the family, with the son present in the room, that the patient's condition is stable, but ultimately is declining.",0
"We explicity told them that things are probably as good as they'll ever be, and that in the future he will have a slow and steady decline.",0
We are limited in interventions that can be done here in hospital and have conveyed that to his family. . .,0

======================================== Mr. ___ is a ___,0
with a hx of CAD (s/p DES to LAD in ___ who presented for a routine stress echo and was found to have evidence of inducible ischemia and aortic insuficiency.,0
ACTIVE ISSUES:,0
Aortic Insufficiency:,0
Unclear etiology.,0
Dissection was ruled out by CTA.,0
There was no root dilation seen on TTE so more likely it is valvular in origin.,0
Patient had no clinical signs of endocarditis and blood cultures had no growth to date.,0
Most likely this is not acute AI given absence of symptoms other than during stress test.,0
It is unclear how long it has been progressing for however.,0
"As for chronic etiologies, patient does not have a marfanoid habitus.",0
He did however have a spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage which may or may not be related.,0
RPR was negative.,0
He did have mantle field radiation for Hodgkins in the 1970s that could theoretically have contributed.,0
On repeat echocardiogram patient did not have LV dilatation and EF was 60%.,0
Clinically he did not have any signs of heart failure.,0
- Since the patient is asymptomatic and appears to be compensated there was no urgent need for surgical evaluation.,0
"The patient was therefore scheduled to follow-up with his cardiologist, Dr. ___ to pursue further workup as an outpatient.",0
- He was started on lisinopril for afterload reduction and diltiazem was stopped ) Positive Stress Test/Hx of CAD: Patient had reversible EKG changes and anginal symptoms while on treadmill.,0
He is known to have coronary artery disease which may have progressed.,0
However it may be that he had demand ischemia from his aortic insufficiency that was further compounding the problem.,0
There were no inducible wall motion abnormalities to suggest a significant functional problem.,0
Since the stress test was performed for stable angina there is no evidence that PCI would have any benefit over medical therapy.,0
Therefore he was discharged to follow-up with his cardiologist Dr. ___ further evaluation.,0
- Could consider left heart cath as outpatient if patient has ischemic symptoms or is being evaluated for AVR - Patient had difficulty tolerating statins because of myalgias therefore he will continue Niacin and Omega 3 fatty acids.,0
LDL was 145 which is significantly above goal of 70.,0
More aggressive LDL control should be discussed at outpatient follow-up with his cardiologist.,0
"- Patient reports that he is not on beta blocker because of fatigue - Continued ASA/Plavix CHRONIC ISSUES: =================== ) Asthma: well controlled - Continued budenoside TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ======================== Patient will follow-up with his cardiologist Dr. ___ further workup of his new Aortic Insufficiency, to discuss his stress test, and to discuss more aggressive LDL lowering CODE STATUS- DNR, Okay to intubate for procedures but would not want prolonged intubation.",0

"Patient had fevers of unknown etiology, blood cultures were drawn which were pending at time of discharge.",0
The patient remained afebrile for 24 hours and was treated for presumed community acquired pneumonia given her subjective symptoms of pleuritic chest pain and pleural effusion on admission CXR.,0
FEVERS - Pt admitted for chest pain but spiked low grade fevers during admission.,0
"Initially placed on empiric vancomycin and zosyn, but continued spiking fevers without apparent source.",0
CXR showed minor pulmonary effusion on the R side.,0
"No localizing infectious symptoms, and fever resolved.",0
"Has reportedly had history of liver cyts which were again demonstrated on RUQ US without RUQ tenderness to palpation, thus not believed to be the source of intermittent fevers.",0

"The patient had an admission EKG and troponins reassuring for ACS, but reported pleuritic chest pain on admission.",0
"Given a sub-therapeutic INR the patient was begun on a heparin drip, and with a recent history of travel and elevated d-dimer a V/Q scan was ordered which showed low probability of a pullmonary embolism.",0
The patient's chest pain resolved completely by hospital day 2.,0
"Given that her only subjective complaint on admission was pleuritic chest pain, it was believed that her pain likely stemmed from a parapneumonic effusion and the patient was treated for community acquired pneumonia.",0

Serratia UTI: Noted on urine culture on ___.,0
He was treated with a course of meropenem. Atrial flutter/fib: MICU course was complicated by recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation and flutter.,0
This initially occurred in the setting of volume removal with CVVH and responded well to doses of metoprolol or diltiazem.,0
"He developed atrial fibrillation with hypotension requiring pressors later in his ICU course during bronchoscopy, requiring amiodarone.",0

"w/ hx of HLD, CAD c/b remote anteroseptal MI, ischemic cardiomyopathy HFrEF (EF=27%) mild/mod MR/TR, CKD, and permanent afib w/ CHB s/p BiV ICD who presented with respiratory distress, found to be in cardiogenic shock c/b possible demand STEMI.",0
He was intubated shortly after arrival to the ED for respiratory distress.,0
"While he was in the ED, his rhythm changed from sinus to a narrow complex tachycardia and ST segment elevations developed over the course of an hour on serial EKGs.",0
He also had polymorphic VT during this time for which amiodarone drip was initiated.,0
"Code STEMI was called, he was given ASA and ticagrelor load and he was taken to the cath lab where he was found to have 95% distal LM disease, 100% ___",0
"LAD stenosis with collateralization from RCA distribution, 40% ___, and 70% ostial RCA disease.",0
"No intervention was performed due to complexity and unclear goals of care; and impella CP was placed through right femoral access while heparin drip initiated; a Swan-ganz catheter was placed in the R femoral vein, and later on an A-line was placed in the right arm.",0
"Goals of care discussion was held, as the patient was previously DNR/DNI and PCI would put him at high risk for needing dialysis given his CKD; there was concern this would not be consistent with his goals as someone who preferred to avoid being in the hospital.",0
The recovery process would additionally likely necessitate a long rehab stint.,0
"Meanwhile, he was treated broadly with vancomycin and Cefepime for fever, likely secondary to lung source.",0
"Due to his Impella he developed complications of hemolysis and hyperkalemia, so was temporized with IV insulin and dextrose.",0
He was not making significant urine so Lasix was a poor option and dialysis was not within goals of care.,0
"Repeat family meeting was held discussing CPR, and it was decided that this would be against the patient's wishes.",0
"At that time, patient was made DNR and ICD was disabled.",0
HCP wished to continue with medical management including impella and ventilator support until family was able to visit the patient.,0
"Overnight on ___, patient had increasingly downtrending MAPs and began alarming for low flow on the impella.",0
"Exam at that point in time was notable for R surgical pupil, L fixed dilated pupil, no corneal reflex, no gag or cough reflex, no withdraw to painful stimuli.",0
Cardiac exam with very faint S1/S2 with weak carotid pulses.,0
Patient was triggering spontaneous breaths on ventilator.,0
"Upon discussion with family at that time, the preference was to wait to discontinue life support until arrival of the daughter.",0
"After that conversation, patient then developed loss of all arterial pulsations on A-line and lost his pulse on exam.",0
He also was noted to be asystolic on telemetry so all supportive measures were withdrawn.,0
He was pronounced disease at 0405 on ___.,0
Family members were immediately contacted and came to bedside.,0
His HCP declined autopsy.,0

Immediate neurology and neurosurgery consults were obtained.,0
"Her hospitalization course is as follows: T12 lesion: Patient has profound lower extremity weakness bilaterally, some of which is baseline from her previous CVA.",0
Her right sided neuro exam is notable for hyperreflexia and clonus which is likely left over from her distant stroke.,0
She was continued on dexamethasone and ISS while on the high dose steroids.,0
"The patient was also given a TLSO brace for ambulation (although initially in too much pain to ambulate), and the head of her bed was kept at <45 degrees.",0
"She received a pre-op myelogram, consistent with an expanding T12 lesion from prior imaging.",0
"She was subsequently taken for decompression surgery by Ortho-Spine Team (s/p T10-L2 fusion, T12 Corpectomy) and transferred to the Ortho-Spine service for post-op management for two days.",0
"When she returned to the medicine service on POD2, the patient was unable to move her lower extremities bilaterally.",0
Ortho-spine service indicated that the patient required additional pain control.,0
"After consult with Neuro-Onc, the patient was transitioned from dexamethasone 10mg Q8 hours to dexamethasone 4mg BID on POD4.",0
She was transferred to the Neurology service for better management of her leg weakness.,0
It was felt this was likely due to post-op pain and inability for her to express her pain level due to her aphasia.,0
Her medications were titrated and she did better on a higher dose fentanyl patch with immediate release morphine and tylenol for breaththrough pain.,0
Subsequently her leg movements improved on better pain control.,0
"She will require XRT for her other bony lesions, and will need to follow up in ___ clinic after XRT (to be arranged by XRT).",0
FED/GI:,0
Patient was found to initially have very mild hypercalcemia on admission.,0
She was NPO for procedure and started on maintenence fluids overnight however did not require agressive IVF.,0
"At the time of surgery, her hypercalcemia resolved.",0
She was advanced to a dysphagia diet post-operatively and did well on that for the rest of her course.,0
Electrolytes were stable with the exception of potassium which kept returning falsely elevated from hemolosis when drawn off her PICC.,0
Foot Fracture: The patient was found to have R foot fracture involving the base of the fifth proximal phalanx with extension to the fifth MTP joint.,0
This was consistent with repeat imaging at ___.,0
"Her L foot and ankles were also imaged because the pt was complaining of additional pain, however, films did not reveal any additional acute fractures.",0
The feet were vascularly intact.,0
"Orthopedics recommended a hard sole boot for when the patient became ambulatory, otherwise, no intervention necessary.",0
Pain:,0
Patient was found in extreme pain when transfered back to medicine service on POD2.,0
Unclear of origin as patient has difficulty communicating due to her aphasia.,0
"Patient's pain was controlled with standing acetaminophen, oxycodone, oxycontin, fentanyl patch and dilaudid IV PRN.",0
The pain team was also consulted to help manage her pain.,0
"She was able to come off the oxycontin on a higher dose of fentanyl patch, and had PO ___ oxycodone and tylenol for break through pain.",0
"Encephalopathy: On POD2, there was noted an increase in aphasia, and confusion, which was difficult to assess given baseline communication issues.",0
HCHCT for acute bleed was negative.,0
The Pt was afebrile and infectious work-up including UA was neg.,0
Urine Ctx and blood ctx were negaitve for occult infection.,0
Her mental status improved with better pain control.,0
"She got a little worse on ___ and was subsequently found to have a new UTI (E Coli), which improved after treating with first ceftriaxone and then Bactrim when sensitivies returned pan-sensitive.",0

"The patient Hct dropped from 32 on POD1--22 on POD2, Hemavac drained only 185cc, pt responded appropriately to 2U PRBC.",0
Unclear where bleed is.,0
Patients Hct subsequent remained stable after transfusion.,0
"A T&L MRI revealed: ""Posterior and right-sided intraspinal fluid collection communicates through the laminectomy defect and causes anterior and left lateral displacement of the thecal sac.",0
This leads to severe encroachment on the distal spinal cord.,0
There are no findings to suggest tumor in this location.,0
"The signal intensity characteristics are typical of simple fluid, rather than hemorrhage.""",0
Her Hct remained stable and the ultimate source of her Hct drop was never identified but felt to be possibly due to post-op hemolysis.,0
The fluid collection was discussed with ortho spine service who felt it could be conservatively watched for now (likely just post-surgical changes).,0
History of Stroke: The patient was continued on home dose of aggrenox until the time of her surgery.,0
"When the patient was transfered back to Medicine on POD2, the aggrenox was held.",0
It was restarted on ___,0
at the consent of orthopedics team.,0

"ECF with AMS, worsening leukocytosis, and anemia in the setting of C diff treatment and indwelling catheter.",0
ACUTE ISSUES: Leukocytosis: WBC 17 on admission.,0
Possibly CA-UTI vs CDiff vs skin soft tissue from pressure ulcer.,0
Per ECF records CXR negative and no hypoxemia or resp sx.,0
Catheter associated UTI most likely source as belly non-tender and stool output moderate suggesting C diff not worsened.,0
Started treatment with ceftriaxone in ED which was continued with drop in WBC from 1713.,0
Never had fever or sepsis syndrome.,0
Second urine culture likely didn't grow more CFU's b/c of prior IV ceftriaxone.,0

MD after her Bactrim DS course for her UTI finishes.,0
Other possibilities include small pressure ulcer on L buttock.,0
Mid back skin shows radiation changes with some skin break but no inflammatory lesions.,0
This was felt to be a less likely cause of her leukocytosis and wound care recommendations were made by wound RNs.,0
"Oliguria: Patient had <0.5 ml/kg/hr urine output for 2 days, though her serum Cr did not elevate.",0
"Foley was draining appropriately and she was not having significant losses in stool, respirations, or sweat.",0
"She was possibly hypovolemic prior to admission, but her UOP did not respond to IVF appropriately, though she was treated with ~2.5 L IVF daily.",0
"Interestingly, her serum creatinine was 0.6-0.8, indicating that she was not having ATN from ischemic injury as this would cause creatinine to rise.",0
"Urine studies showed urine Na 60 indicating that she was not having high aldosterone activity, though she is on an ___.",0
Urine osms were in the 600s indicating appropriate concentration.,0
"Ultimately, she was thought to be intravascularly hypovolemic, possibly secondary to hypoalbuminemia (total protein only 4 on admission).",0
"PO intake was encouraged, but was marginal.",0
She will need follow up of urine output at her ECF to ensure improvement.,0
Encephalopathy: Baseline NOT normal.,0
This may represent delirium superimposed on dementia.,0
"At baseline she is A&Ox1-2, can have some conversation with infelicitous remarks.",0
"Per son, she does not hallucinate at baseline and is not floridly confused, and she may participate in some limited conversation.",0
Her change from baseline is likely related to acute infection with UTI being most likely cause given no documentation of worsened diarrhea.,0
"Previous w/u for B12, TSH, folate negative and at last discharge and was d/c with increased seroquel and started citalopram.",0
Her home quetiapine and mirtazipine were continued and her underlying infections were treated.,0

Access: Had PICC at ECF that she pulled ___ in delirium.,0
Unclear if she will need long term access for IVF in setting of ongoing diarrhea.,0
Had been getting ~2L daily at ___,0
during initial C diff tx.,0
After IVF resuscitation was managing to take moderate PO intake.,0
"need access long term in the future, but her mental status may cause her to remove any lines.",0
HTN: Well controlled on outpatient regimen.,0
Not tachycardic to suggest hypotension though AV nodal blocked.,0
BPs 120s-130s.,0
All home meds continued on discharge.,0
"HLD: On statin, continued.",0
GOALS OF CARE:,0
"We contacted the patient's son and daughter-in-law to discuss her care and it was expressed that we cannot likely fix her mental status and that she would likely continue to return to the hospital with worsening recurrent infections, including resistant UTIs and recurrent C diff diarrhea, because of her need for an indwelling Foley and frequent antibiotics.",0
It was explained that Dr. ___ better explain her oncologic prognosis.,0
"However, the gestalt was that she is not thriving and that despite aggressive medical care she may continue to decline.",0
"This judgment was based on her: baseline impaired cognition (possibly dementia), her physical dependence for movement, her need for an indwelling catheter to prevent soiling and infections of decubitus ulcers, her inability to get a suprapubic catheter because of her likelihood of pulling it out in confusion, and her recurrent C diff related to frequent antibiotics.",0
The family was interested in talking about her goals of care in conjunction with Dr. ___ to better clarify her trajectory and future medical interventions.,0
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: --Goals of care conversation with family regarding recurrent hospitalization.,0
--vancomycin taper after completing PO bactrim course ___ --Reassess need for chronic indwelling Foley which predisposes to infection Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.,0
